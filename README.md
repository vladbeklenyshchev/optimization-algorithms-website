# optimization-algorithms-website
This website represents first- and second-order methods of optimization.
You can calculate value for function f(x, y) = a * x^2 + b * x * y + c * y^2 using 9 methods thaw we implemented in JavaScript. 
App allows you to enter values a, b and c in the input field above the logo of the website.
Also we have to say that website is a big laboratory work for our "Web-programming" discipline (5 course).
